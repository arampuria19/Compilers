Documenting and creating a README file for code is essential to help other developers understand how to use your code, what it does, and how to contribute or modify it. Below is a suggested structure for documenting your LR(0) grammar automaton code and creating a README file:

## LR(0) Grammar Automaton

This is a Python implementation of an LR(0) grammar automaton, which can be used for parsing context-free grammars. The LR(0) parser can generate a parsing table for a given grammar and can be used to parse input strings based on that grammar.

### Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There are no external dependencies for this code. You can simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lr0-grammar-automaton.git
```

### Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To use this LR(0) grammar automaton, follow these steps:

1. Import the `grammarAugmentation` and other required functions from the code.

2. Define your grammar rules, non-terminals, and terminals in Python lists.

3. Call the `grammarAugmentation` function to preprocess your grammar rules.

4. Use the `findClosure`, `computeGOTO`, and `generateStates` functions to compute the LR(0) states and transitions.

5. Call the `createParseTable` function to generate the parsing table for your grammar.

6. You can then use the parsing table to parse input strings based on your grammar.

### Example <a name="example"></a>

Here is a simple example of how to use this LR(0) grammar automaton:

```python
# Import required functions
from lr0_grammar_automaton import grammarAugmentation, findClosure, computeGOTO, generateStates, createParseTable

# Define your grammar rules, non-terminals, and terminals
rules = ["S -> E",
         "E -> E + T | T",
         "T -> T * F | F",
         "F -> ( E ) | id"]

nonterminals = ['S', 'E', 'T', 'F']
terminals = ['+', '*', '(', ')', 'id']

# Preprocess the grammar rules
start_symbol = nonterminals[0]
augmented_rules = grammarAugmentation(rules, nonterminals, start_symbol)

# Compute LR(0) states and transitions
statesDict = {}
stateMap = {}
I0 = findClosure(0, start_symbol)
statesDict[0] = I0
stateCount = 0
generateStates(statesDict)

# Generate the parsing table
createParseTable(statesDict, stateMap, terminals, nonterminals)

# Now you can use the parsing table to parse input strings based on your grammar.
```

#### Functions

- `grammarAugmentation(rules, nonterm_userdef, start_symbol)`: Augments the grammar rules to create LR(0) items.

- `findClosure(input_state, dotSymbol)`: Finds the closure of a given LR(0) item set.

- `computeGOTO(state)`: Computes the GOTO function for a given LR(0) state.

- `GOTO(state, charNextToDot)`: Computes the GOTO function for a given symbol.

- `generateStates(statesDict)`: Generates all LR(0) states for a given grammar.

- `first(rule)`: Computes the FIRST set for a given grammar rule.

- `follow(nt)`: Computes the FOLLOW set for a given non-terminal.

- `createParseTable(statesDict, stateMap, T, NT)`: Creates the LR(0) parsing table.

- `printResult(rules)`: Prints the resulting LR(0) grammar rules.

- `printAllGOTO(diction)`: Prints all GOTO states.
